# Description

In this project, Amazon SageMaker was used to implement a specific RNN (Recurrent
Neural Network), a LSTM (LongShort Term Memory) end to end in order to predict
sentiments in movie reviews via a simple web interface. The LSTM was trained on
the Large Movie Review Dataset (IMDb) dataset, which can be found [here.](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
After training, the model can predit very well whether the overall sentiment of
the film review is 'positive' or 'negative'.

## Prerequisites
This project requires knowledge on SageMaker plus Amazon's infrastructure. Both
 can be gathered [here.](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/blob/master/README.md)


## Installation
The overall set up instructions are [here.](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/blob/master/README.md)
The repository can be cloned using:

```
